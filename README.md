*clf4D_MTDquality_bo.xml* 
BDT with 14 inputs trained to classify good track+MTD association on the basis of the track parameters (reconstructed parameters + track pattern) and matching chi2 in MTD (space and time). Training has been performed on PU200 TTbar events in CMSSW_10_4_0_mtd5, using a dedicated reReco of MTD TDR samples which used a time beam spot constraint in addition to the space chi2.
