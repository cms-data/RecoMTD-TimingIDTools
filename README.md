*BDT_nvars_17_d7.xml*

BDT with 17 inputs trained to classify good track+MTD association on the basis of the track parameters (reconstructed parameters + track pattern) and matching chi2 in MTD (space and time). Training has been performed on the `/RelValTTbar_14TeV/CMSSW_15_1_0_pre2-PU_150X_mcRun4_realistic_v1_STD_Run4D110_PU-v1/GEN-SIM-RECO` dataset.
